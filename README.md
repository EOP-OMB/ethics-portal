# OMB Ethics Portal

The OMB Ethics Portal provides several automated functions to augment the General Council ethics related workload.  These functions are form OGE-450 workflow and reporting, annual ethics training tracking, and event clearance request submission and approval workflow.

**OGE-450**:  Used by executive branch employees who are less senior than public filers to report their financial interests as well as other interests outside the Government. The purpose of this report is to assist employees and their agencies in avoiding conflicts between duties and private financial interests or affiliations.  Assigning and managing confidential financial disclosure reports is a substantial project for many agencies.  It is critical that agencies have a system that stores important ethics information and is easily searchable.  The OGE-450 app as part of the OMB Ethics Portal includes the functions that permit easy review and clearance, compliance reviews, and reporting.

**Ethics Training**:  Staff attest that they have attended annual Ethics training, including date and location.  That data is used for tracking and reporting the annual requirement.

**Event Clearance**:  This is a form-based application that staff utilize to request attendance to public events that may include speaking engagements.  Guidance and approvals are tracked and maintained for reference.

**Guidance Tracker**:  The GC can utilize this app for tracking any guidance supplied to an employee.  It ties the guidance directly to the employee and allows reusable responses and full history.
