            Title I of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C. app. 101), Executive Order 12674 (as modified by Executive Order 12731), and 5
            CFR Part 2634, Subpart I, of the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) regulations require the reporting of this information. Failure to
            provide the requested information may result in separation or disciplinary action. The primary use of the information on this form is for
            review by Government officials of your agency, to determine compliance with applicable Federal conflict of interest laws and regulations.
            Additional disclosures may be made pursuant to the routine uses set forth in OGE/GOVT-2: (1) to a Federal, State, or local law
            enforcement agency if the disclosing agency becomes aware of a violation or potential violation of law or regulation; (2) to a source when
            necessary to obtain information relevant to a conflict of interest investigation or decision; (3) to the National Archives and Records
            Administration in records management inspections; (4) to the Office of Management and Budget during legislative coordination on private
            relief legislation; (5) when the disclosing agency determines that the records are arguably relevant to a proceeding before a court, grand
            jury, or administrative or adjudicative body, or when the adjudicator determines the records to be relevant to the proceeding; (6) to
            reviewing officials in a new office, department or agency when an employee transfers or is detailed from one covered position to another;
            (7) to a Member of Congress or a congressional office in response to an inquiry made on behalf of and at the request of an individual who
            is the subject of the record; (8) to contractors and other non-Government employees working for the Federal Government to accomplish a
            function related to this OGE Government-wide system of records; (9) to appropriate agencies, entities and persons when there has been a
            suspected or confirmed breach of the system of records, the agency maintaining the records has determined that there is a risk of harm to
            individuals, the agency, the Federal Government, or national security, and the disclosure is reasonably necessary to assist in connection
            with the agency's efforts to respond to the suspected or confirmed breach or to prevent, minimize, or remedy such harm; and (10) to
            another Federal agency or Federal entity, when the agency maintaining the record determines that information from this system of records
            is reasonably necessary to assist the recipient agency or entity in responding to a suspected or confirmed breach or in preventing,
            minimizing, or remedying the risk of harm to individuals, the recipient agency or entity, the Federal Government, or national security.
            Note: When an agency is requested to furnish such records to OGE, such a disclosure is to be considered as made to those officers and
            employees of the agency which co-maintains the records who have a need for the records in the performance of their official duties in
            accordance with the Ethics in Government Act and other pertinent authority conferred on OGE, pursuant to the provisions of the Privacy
            Act at 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(1). This confidential report will not be disclosed to any requesting person unless authorized by law. See also the
            OGE/GOVT-2 Executive Branch Confidential Financial Disclosure Reports Privacy Act system of records.
