/**
 * The series type.
 *
 * The supported values are:
 * - `"area"`&mdash;Displays the data as continuous lines that show trends over time, evenly distributed along the category field.
 * - `"bar"`&mdash;Displays the data as sets of horizontal bars that show the relationship between individual items and the whole category.
 * - `"boxPlot"`&mdash;Displays the data as a box-and-whisker diagram, which shows the distribution of values in a series.
 * - `"bubble"`&mdash;Displays the data as bubbles, where each bubble represents a value from the series data.
 * - `"bullet"`&mdash;Displays the data as vertical bars that show the performance measure, and markers that show the comparative measure.
 * - `"candlestick"`&mdash;Displays the data as candlesticks, which show the open, close, high, and low values of a series.
 * - `"column"`&mdash;Displays the data as sets of vertical bars that show the relationship between individual items and the whole category.
 * - `"donut"`&mdash;Displays the data as a series of rings that are sliced depending on the value.
 * - `"funnel"`&mdash;Displays the data as a funnel, which is useful for sales data visualization.
 * - `"heatmap"`&mdash;Displays the data as a heatmap, which is useful for comparing values in a matrix.
 * - `"horizontalWaterfall"`&mdash;Displays the data as a horizontal waterfall chart, which is useful for comparing positive and negative values over a period.
 * - `"line"`&mdash;Displays the data as continuous lines that connect data points evenly distributed along the category field.
 * - `"ohlc"`&mdash;Displays the data as OHLC (open-high-low-close) bars, which show the open, high, low, and close values of a series.
 * - `"pie"`&mdash;Displays the data as a series of pie slices, which show the contribution of each value to a total.
 * - `"polarArea"`&mdash;Displays the data as a series of polar area segments, which show the contribution of each value to a total.
 * - `"polarLine"`&mdash;Displays the data as continuous lines that connect data points evenly distributed along the category field.
 * - `"polarScatter"`&mdash;Displays the data as points distributed in a polar coordinate system.
 * - `"radarArea"`&mdash;Displays the data as a series of radar area segments, which show the contribution of each value to a total.
 * - `"radarColumn"`&mdash;Displays the data as sets of vertical bars that show the relationship between individual items and the whole category.
 * - `"radarLine"`&mdash;Displays the data as continuous lines that connect data points evenly distributed along the category field.
 * - `"rangeArea"`&mdash;Displays the data as a series of range area segments, which show the contribution of each value to a total.
 * - `"rangeBar"`&mdash;Displays the data as sets of horizontal bars that show the relationship between individual items and the whole category.
 * - `"rangeColumn"`&mdash;Displays the data as sets of vertical bars that show the relationship between individual items and the whole category.
 * - `"scatter"`&mdash;Displays the data as points that show the relationship between two variables.
 * - `"scatterLine"`&mdash;Displays the data as continuous lines that connect data points evenly distributed along the category field.
 * - `"verticalArea"`&mdash;Displays the data as continuous lines that show trends over time, evenly distributed along the category field.
 * - `"verticalBoxPlot"`&mdash;Displays the data as a box-and-whisker diagram, which shows the distribution of values in a series.
 * - `"verticalBullet"`&mdash;Displays the data as vertical bars that show the performance measure, and markers that show the comparative measure.
 * - `"verticalLine"`&mdash;Displays the data as continuous lines that connect data points evenly distributed along the category field.
 * - `"verticalRangeArea"`&mdash;Displays the data as a series of range area segments, which show the contribution of each value to a total.
 * - `"waterfall"`&mdash;Displays the data as a waterfall chart, which is useful for comparing positive and negative values over a period.
